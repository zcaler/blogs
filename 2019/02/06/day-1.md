# DevOps Evolution Continues with GitOps and Infrastructure as Code

DevOps practices continue to evolve with GitOps emerging as a structured approach to managing infrastructure and application deployments through Git workflows.

This methodology, popularized by tools like Flux and ArgoCD, treats Git repositories as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and application configuration.

Changes to production environments happen only after code has been committed, reviewed, and merged, bringing the same rigor to infrastructure management that developers have long applied to application code.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Pulumi have become standard components of modern deployment pipelines, enabling teams to provision and manage cloud resources through version-controlled configuration files.

These tools are increasingly adopting higher-level programming models that provide better abstractions, improved reusability, and stronger validation capabilities.

The concept of "everything as code" now extends beyond infrastructure to security policies, monitoring configurations, and even documentation, all managed through the same Git-based workflows and automation pipelines.

While the tooling has matured considerably, organizations still face challenges around team structure, security practices, and cultural transformation as they adopt these highly automated approaches.

The most successful DevOps implementations focus not just on toolchain integration but on cross-functional collaboration, shared responsibility, and continuous improvement of both technical practices and organizational processes.

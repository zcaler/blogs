# Progressive Web Apps Continue to Bridge the Mobile Gap

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are evolving rapidly as a viable alternative to native mobile applications in early 2019.

Companies like Twitter, Starbucks, and Pinterest have all reported significant increases in engagement after implementing PWA versions of their platforms.

The technology combines the best aspects of web and mobile apps, offering features like offline functionality, push notifications, and home screen installation while avoiding the friction of app store downloads.

Google has been particularly active in promoting PWAs, integrating them deeply with Android and providing robust development tools through Lighthouse and Workbox.

Apple has been slower to adopt certain PWA features in Safari, but recent iOS updates have brought improved support, suggesting the technology's future cross-platform potential.

As browser vendors continue to implement the necessary APIs, we're seeing PWAs becoming an increasingly attractive option for businesses looking to reach users across all devices with a single codebase.

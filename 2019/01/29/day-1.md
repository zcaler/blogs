# GraphQL Adoption Accelerates Among Major API Providers

GraphQL continues its impressive growth trajectory in early 2019 as more organizations move away from REST APIs toward this more flexible query language.

Originally developed by Facebook in 2015, GraphQL has now been adopted by major tech companies including GitHub, Shopify, Twitter, and Airbnb for their API offerings.

The technology addresses many pain points of traditional REST APIs by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of information.

Tools like Apollo Client and Relay are maturing rapidly, making it easier for frontend developers to integrate with GraphQL backends and manage application state.

On the server side, implementations are available for virtually every major programming language, with particularly strong ecosystems in Node.js, Ruby, and Python.

The rise of GraphQL has sparked conversations about API design best practices, with many teams reporting significant productivity gains after making the switch from REST.

Despite these advantages, GraphQL adoption still faces challenges related to caching, rate limiting, and the learning curve for teams deeply experienced with REST paradigms.

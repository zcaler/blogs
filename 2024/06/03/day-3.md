# DevOps in Mid-2024: AI Integration and Platform Engineering Take Center Stage

As we move deeper into 2024, the buzz around DevOps is less about "what" and more about "how" and "with what." AI-powered testing and incident management are rapidly becoming commonplace, significantly reducing mean time to resolution (MTTR).

Platform engineering is also exploding, empowering development teams with self-service infrastructure and pre-configured development environments managed through Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs).

Observability tools are now deeply integrated with security, creating a DevSecOps feedback loop focused on real-time threat detection and automated remediation.

Serverless architectures are gaining even more traction driven by reduced operational overhead and scalability.

Containerization, mainly using Kubernetes, is a given now, with efforts focusing on optimizing resource utilization and costs within these environments.

Security continues to be paramount, with tools specializing in supply chain security and SBOM management becoming crucial for mitigating risks from open-source dependencies.

The focus is on automation, efficiency, and security to help businesses achieve faster time to market.

# Machine Learning: June 2024 - Efficiency and Embodiment Take Center Stage

June is shaping up to be a landmark month for Machine Learning! We're seeing major efficiency gains across the board, particularly in large language model (LLM) inference.

New quantization techniques and optimized transformer architectures are enabling significantly faster and cheaper deployment of models like GPT-4 on edge devices.

Excitingly, research into embodied AI is accelerating.

Boston Dynamics has unveiled Atlas with enhanced fine motor skills learned through a novel reinforcement learning approach, paving the way for more practical robotics applications in warehouses and construction.

Meanwhile, researchers at MIT are exploring the use of self-supervised learning for teaching robots complex assembly tasks, leading to a potential revolution in automated manufacturing.

Finally, synthetic data generation is proving invaluable for training robust and safe autonomous vehicle systems.

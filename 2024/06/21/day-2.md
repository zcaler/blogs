# Cloud Computing: Mid-Year 2024 Trends & Future Directions

June 2024 paints a clear picture: generative AI is no longer just on the horizon; it's actively shaping cloud strategies.

We're seeing accelerated adoption of specialized AI infrastructure, particularly GPUs, from providers like AWS's Trainium and Google's TPU v5e.

Serverless architectures are also evolving to better handle the demands of these AI workloads, moving beyond simple functions to support complex, stateful AI pipelines.

The industry is heavily invested in making AI models more accessible and efficient, with new advancements in quantization and model compression optimized for cloud deployment.

Container orchestration is becoming increasingly important for managing these disparate AI components across hybrid and multi-cloud environments, driving innovation in platforms like Kubernetes.

Finally, security remains a crucial focus, with emerging techniques like confidential computing gaining traction to protect sensitive AI data both in transit and at rest within cloud environments.

These shifts mark a significant evolution, promising a future where AI is seamlessly integrated into core cloud services.

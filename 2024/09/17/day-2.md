# Big Data Analytics in 2024: The Rise of Quantum-Assisted Processing

Big Data Analytics in late 2024 is no longer just about massive datasets; it's about velocity and complexity.

We're seeing a significant uptake in quantum-assisted processing for specific tasks like anomaly detection and highly complex simulations.

While full quantum supremacy in data analytics isn't here yet, hybrid classical-quantum architectures are proving invaluable in areas where speed is paramount.

Ethical AI is also taking center stage.

Data governance frameworks are now legally required to include explainability and bias mitigation, pushing forward the adoption of advanced explainable AI tools integrated directly into big data platforms.

This demand for transparency is fostering the development of new, more robust data provenance techniques.

Finally, federated learning is becoming increasingly popular for privacy-preserving analytics, especially in healthcare and finance, minimizing the need for centralized data storage and reducing data security risks.

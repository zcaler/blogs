# Edge Computing: The Maturing Landscape

Edge computing has truly come into its own this year.

Federated learning on the edge is now commonplace, enabling personalized AI experiences without compromising user privacy.

We're seeing wider adoption of standardized edge platforms like those built on open-source Kubernetes derivatives, streamlining deployment across heterogeneous hardware.

This standardization also facilitates the integration of specialized hardware accelerators, like the new generation of neuromorphic chips, directly at the edge for demanding applications like real-time autonomous vehicle control.

The development of lightweight, low-power serverless functions tailored for edge deployment is further expanding the possibilities.

Security remains a paramount concern, with ongoing advancements in hardware-based root of trust and AI-powered threat detection at the network perimeter.

Early adopters are already seeing significant ROI in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics thanks to these advancements.

# Web Dev Landscape: Late 2024 - What's Hot

The web development world in late 2024 is buzzing.

AI-powered code completion is now seamlessly integrated into most IDEs, significantly boosting developer productivity, especially when working with the ever-evolving specifications of WebAssembly components.

Serverless functions, particularly edge-optimized solutions like Cloudflare Workers and Deno Deploy, are becoming the de facto standard for microservices.

We're also seeing a surge in adoption of typed JavaScript supersets like TypeScript 5.x, coupled with a renewed focus on web accessibility as regulatory pressures mount.

Federated GraphQL implementations are making headway, allowing teams to build more complex APIs by composing existing graph services.

Finally, while still experimental, the continued refinement of WebGPU and advancements in real-time rendering frameworks, like Three.fiber, are pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the browser.

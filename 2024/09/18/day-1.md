# Web Development in Late 2024: The AI Integration Era

September 18th, 2024, sees web development firmly in the grip of AI-powered tooling.

Generative AI has moved beyond simple code completion and is now integral to UI/UX design, with tools capable of creating complete component libraries based on brand guidelines in minutes.

The focus has shifted to prompt engineering and curating datasets to feed these models.

Serverless functions, accelerated by WebAssembly modules compiled from Rust, are the norm for backend logic due to their efficiency and scalability.

Interactive, AI-powered debugging tools are helping to shorten testing cycles dramatically.

Accessibility is no longer an afterthought, with automated auditing tools built directly into IDEs ensuring WCAG compliance from the start.

Finally, decentralized web technologies are gaining traction, presenting new challenges and opportunities for developers to consider.

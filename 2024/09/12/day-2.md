# The IoT Landscape in Late 2024: Embedded AI and the Edge Take Center Stage

The second half of 2024 sees a significant acceleration in embedded AI for IoT devices.

We're moving beyond simple sensor data reporting to seeing complex real-time analytics happening directly on the device itself, fueled by advancements in low-power AI chips.

Federated learning is also gaining traction, allowing IoT deployments to improve models without centralizing sensitive data.

Security remains a key area of focus, with hardware-based security modules becoming increasingly prevalent to combat rising botnet attacks targeting vulnerable devices.

5G rollouts have broadened connectivity and reduced latency, facilitating more demanding IoT applications in areas like autonomous vehicles and smart factories.

Finally, the standardization of Matter is starting to bear fruit, leading to improved interoperability between different vendors and platforms, simplifying deployment and management for end-users.

Expect to see this trend accelerate as we move into 2025.

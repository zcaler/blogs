# IoT: Edge Intelligence Takes Center Stage - September 12, 2024

The buzz around IoT is quieter these days, but the *implementation* is roaring.

The shift isn't about new devices, but about processing.

Remember when everything needed cloud connectivity? Not anymore.

Edge intelligence is finally delivering on its promise.

We're seeing widespread deployment of AI-powered microcontrollers in factories and smart cities.

Federated learning on edge devices enables rapid model refinement without centralizing data.

This advancement dramatically reduces latency, enhances privacy, and boosts reliability.

New 6G-enabled edge servers further accelerate this trend.

Security remains a key focus, with hardware-based trust anchors becoming mandatory for newly deployed IoT devices.

The move towards localized processing power is truly unlocking the potential of IoT, and we can finally realize tangible benefits.

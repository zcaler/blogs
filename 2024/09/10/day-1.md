# IoT: Edge Intelligence Takes Center Stage (September 10, 2024)

It's hard to believe we're already well into Q3 of 2024! The biggest shift we're seeing in the IoT landscape continues to be the aggressive push toward edge computing.

We're finally moving beyond just collecting data from sensors and actually processing it locally.

Think real-time predictive maintenance on factory floors using AI models deployed directly on industrial IoT gateways, minimizing latency and bandwidth needs.

This has been accelerated by the commoditization of powerful, low-power processors like the ARM Cortex-M85, making edge AI much more accessible.

Privacy concerns are also fueling this trend, with more companies opting to process sensitive data on-site to avoid cloud transfers.

Battery life improvements for wireless sensors are also significantly contributing, allowing for more complex edge processing without sacrificing deployment longevity.

The rise of federated learning techniques, where models are trained collaboratively across decentralized edge devices, is opening exciting new possibilities for personalized and adaptive IoT experiences.

We anticipate further advancements in secure boot and attestation for edge devices to ensure the integrity of these distributed AI models in the coming months.

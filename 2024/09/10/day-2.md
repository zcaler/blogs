# IoT: Edge Intelligence Takes Center Stage in Q3 2024

The Internet of Things landscape continues its rapid evolution here in Q3 2024, with the dominant trend being the push towards edge intelligence.

We're seeing a massive surge in deployments leveraging specialized AI accelerators embedded directly within IoT devices.

This minimizes latency, crucial for applications like autonomous vehicle fleets and predictive maintenance in factories, and significantly reduces reliance on cloud connectivity, enhancing security and privacy.

Federated learning is becoming increasingly prevalent, allowing devices to collaboratively improve AI models without sharing raw data, a boon for industries handling sensitive information.

Battery life remains a challenge, but advancements in energy harvesting and ultra-low-power chip designs are showing promise.

Expect to see even deeper integration of AI-powered IoT solutions into everyday life in the coming months, driving efficiency and automation across various sectors.

We are also seeing a consolidation in IoT platforms, with fewer players dominating the market.

The focus is now shifting towards simplifying device management and security at scale.

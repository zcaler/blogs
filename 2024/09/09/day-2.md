# Web Development in Autumn 2024: AI-Powered Design and the Rise of Decentralized Front-Ends

As we head into autumn 2024, the web development landscape is seeing some significant shifts.

AI-powered design tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing developers to rapidly prototype and generate UI components with minimal manual coding.

Simultaneously, we're witnessing a growing interest in decentralized front-ends leveraging technologies like IPFS and blockchain for enhanced security and censorship resistance.

Serverless architectures continue to dominate backend strategies, further accelerating deployment cycles.

While React and Vue.js remain popular, frameworks prioritizing web assembly (WASM) are gaining traction for performance-critical applications.

The focus is now on creating web experiences that are not only fast and scalable, but also secure, user-centric, and resilient to centralized control.

Expect to see more innovations in AI-driven accessibility features and cross-platform development in the coming months.

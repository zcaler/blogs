# Edge Computing: March 2024 Update

Edge computing continues its rapid evolution, particularly driven by the demands of AI and real-time applications.

We're seeing significant advancements in serverless edge functions from providers like AWS Lambda@Edge and Azure Functions on IoT Edge, simplifying deployment and management.

A key trend is the integration of specialized hardware, such as NVIDIA's Jetson Orin series, directly into edge devices to accelerate AI inference at the source.

This is especially crucial for applications like autonomous vehicles and predictive maintenance.

Security remains a top concern, with increased focus on hardware-based root of trust and secure enclaves for data protection at the edge.

Standardization efforts through groups like the LF Edge are gaining momentum, aiming to create interoperable and open edge ecosystems.

Finally, expect to see more widespread adoption of 5G and satellite connectivity to support increasingly distributed edge deployments.

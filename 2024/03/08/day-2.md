# DevOps in Early March 2024: Focus on AI Integration and Serverless Security

March 8th, 2024, finds DevOps teams increasingly focused on integrating AI-powered tools into their pipelines for automated testing and performance monitoring.

We're seeing a surge in demand for platforms like Grafana and Prometheus with enhanced machine learning capabilities.

Serverless architecture is also experiencing a security renaissance, with new tools emerging to address vulnerabilities specific to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS).

Specifically, runtime application self-protection (RASP) tailored for serverless environments is gaining traction.

Furthermore, organizations are prioritizing GitOps strategies, emphasizing declarative infrastructure-as-code for improved stability and auditability.

Expect to see even more advancements in these areas throughout the rest of the year, especially as businesses look for ways to optimize cloud costs and enhance security posture.

# DevOps in Early March 2024: Automation and Security Take Center Stage

As we move into March 2024, the DevOps landscape is increasingly focused on enhanced automation and tighter security integrations.

We're seeing a surge in adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Pulumi, not just for provisioning, but also for managing compliance and security policies directly within the infrastructure definition.

Container security, particularly in Kubernetes environments, is getting significant attention with advancements in vulnerability scanning and runtime protection.

Observability is also evolving beyond simple monitoring, incorporating AI-powered anomaly detection for proactive issue resolution.

Furthermore, the rise of low-code/no-code platforms is starting to influence DevOps, allowing citizen developers to contribute to workflows, albeit with careful governance needed to maintain security and standardization.

The industry is actively discussing how to best incorporate AI in the SDLC without compromising security.

The discussion of serverless deployments is also picking up a pace.

Finally, the continued skills gap necessitates greater focus on training and upskilling existing teams to effectively leverage these emerging technologies.

# Cloud Computing: March 2024 Developments

This month, we're seeing significant traction in specialized cloud instances designed for AI/ML workloads.

Both AWS and Azure are expanding their offerings with enhanced GPU acceleration, catering to the increasing demand for training large language models.

Serverless computing is also evolving, with vendors introducing better support for complex workflows and event-driven architectures, moving beyond simple functions.

Security remains a key focus, with enhanced encryption and threat detection tools being integrated more deeply into cloud platforms.

We're also observing a push towards multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud solutions, as businesses seek greater flexibility and resilience in their infrastructure.

Kubernetes continues to be the de facto standard for container orchestration, fostering easier portability across different cloud environments.

Finally, expect to see more emphasis on sustainable cloud practices, driven by corporate ESG goals and stricter regulatory requirements.

# Web Development Trends & Tech on the Horizon (March 15, 2024)

The web development landscape in early 2024 is buzzing with excitement around several key trends.

Serverless functions, leveraging platforms like AWS Lambda and Netlify Functions, are gaining serious traction for their scalability and cost-effectiveness, enabling more dynamic and responsive web applications.

We're also seeing a continued rise in AI-powered tools assisting developers with code generation, debugging, and even automated testing â€“ promising a future of increased efficiency.

Accessibility remains a central focus, pushing developers to adopt and enforce WCAG guidelines.

On the frontend, component libraries like React, Vue, and Svelte are constantly evolving, offering improved performance and developer experiences with each iteration.

And finally, expect WebAssembly to solidify its place, allowing for near-native performance in the browser, particularly important for demanding applications like games and complex simulations.

# Web Development Trends: March 2024 Update

March 2024 is seeing increased adoption of serverless architecture, with platforms like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions becoming increasingly attractive for their scalability and cost-effectiveness.

Interest in Bun, a JavaScript runtime gaining traction for its speed and built-in tooling, is also on the rise.

AI-powered development tools are becoming more sophisticated, offering features like code completion and automated bug detection directly within IDEs.

Accessibility continues to be a primary focus, with developers prioritizing WCAG compliance and inclusive design principles from the outset of projects.

Furthermore, micro frontend architectures are proving valuable for large-scale applications needing independent deployments by multiple teams.

These trends are all contributing to a faster, more efficient, and more accessible web development landscape.

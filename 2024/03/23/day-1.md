# Cybersecurity Trends: Spring 2024

As we head into Spring, several cybersecurity trends are demanding attention.

Phishing attacks leveraging AI-generated deepfakes for increased realism are becoming increasingly prevalent, making user awareness training more crucial than ever.

The race to patch vulnerabilities in commonly used open-source libraries continues, fueled by recent exploits targeting widely deployed software.

Quantum computing advancements, while still nascent, are driving a renewed focus on post-quantum cryptography research and development.

Regulatory pressure for enhanced data privacy and breach notification is also mounting globally, compelling organizations to invest in robust compliance programs.

Finally, the shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals persists, pushing companies to explore automation and managed security service providers to address their security needs.

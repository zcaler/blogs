# IoT in 2024: Beyond Smart Homes, Into Smart Industries

November 1, 2024: The Internet of Things landscape has shifted considerably in the past few years.

We're seeing less hype around connected refrigerators and more focus on industrial applications.

Low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN) like enhanced NB-IoT are now ubiquitous, enabling massive sensor deployments for predictive maintenance in manufacturing and smart agriculture.

The security vulnerabilities of early IoT devices are largely mitigated with hardware-based security and robust authentication protocols becoming standard.

Edge computing is a key enabler, allowing for real-time data processing directly at the source, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

Furthermore, the interoperability challenges are being addressed through standardized communication protocols and data formats, making it easier to integrate IoT devices from different vendors.

Federated learning is also gaining traction, allowing AI models to be trained on decentralized IoT data without compromising privacy.

Consequently, IoT is now a core component of Industry 5.0, driving efficiency and automation across various sectors.

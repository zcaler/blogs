# Blockchain Beyond Crypto: November 2024 Update

Blockchain technology continues its expansion far beyond cryptocurrency.

Supply chain solutions are now almost universally utilizing permissioned blockchains for enhanced transparency and traceability, dramatically reducing counterfeiting across pharmaceuticals and luxury goods.

Decentralized identity (DID) solutions built on verifiable credentials are gaining significant traction, particularly in government services, allowing citizens secure and controlled access to vital records.

The energy sector is actively exploring blockchain-based microgrids for peer-to-peer energy trading, aiming for increased efficiency and reduced reliance on centralized utilities.

Quantum-resistant blockchains are becoming a research priority as quantum computing advances.

Even within traditional finance, tokenized securities are slowly but steadily gaining acceptance, offering fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity in previously illiquid assets.

The focus is shifting from volatile crypto assets to practical, enterprise-grade applications that leverage the core strengths of distributed ledger technology.

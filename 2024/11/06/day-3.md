# Edge Computing: Where We're At Now (November 6, 2024)

Edge computing has truly exploded this year, driven primarily by advancements in neural network quantization.

We're now seeing incredibly complex AI models running directly on low-power edge devices, enabling real-time decision-making that was previously impossible.

Federated learning is also becoming mainstream, allowing models to be trained across distributed edge nodes without compromising data privacy, a huge win for healthcare and finance.

Security remains a critical focus, with new hardware-based root of trust solutions becoming commonplace in edge deployments.

The widespread adoption of 5G and Wi-Fi 7 is further fueling the edge revolution, offering the necessary bandwidth and low latency for demanding applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality.

Look out for increased consolidation in the edge platform market, with major players vying to offer comprehensive, end-to-end solutions.

Finally, remember the rise of specialized edge processing units tailored for various workloads, optimizing power efficiency and performance for specific tasks like computer vision and sensor fusion.

# Edge Computing: Where We Stand in Late 2024

The evolution of edge computing continues at breakneck speed.

This year we've seen significant advancements in Federated Learning deployed at the edge, enabling more robust and privacy-preserving AI models for applications like autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure.

Hardware has also caught up; specialized, low-power processors from companies like Graphcore and Mythic are finally proving their real-world viability in demanding edge environments, significantly boosting on-device AI capabilities.

Security remains paramount, and advancements in homomorphic encryption are making data processing at the edge far more secure without compromising performance.

Furthermore, 6G rollout is accelerating edge adoption, providing the ultra-low latency and high bandwidth needed for the next generation of augmented reality and remote robotics applications.

The integration of Quantum computing and edge devices is creating enhanced data processing opportunities never seen before.

The rise of distributed ledger technology is also improving the security and traceability of data at the edge.

As we move into 2025, expect even greater emphasis on sustainable edge deployments, with energy efficiency becoming a critical factor in hardware and software design.

# Cybersecurity Trends: Navigating the Post-Quantum Landscape (November 27, 2024)

The cybersecurity landscape is shifting dramatically as we near practical quantum computing.

Homomorphic encryption is gaining serious traction for protecting data in use, especially within cloud environments.

We're also seeing a surge in AI-powered threat detection, moving beyond simple anomaly detection to proactively anticipate attacker strategies.

Deepfake-as-a-service attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making identity verification a critical battleground.

Hardware-level security, driven by advancements in Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) and secure enclaves, is playing a bigger role in endpoint protection.

Finally, expect more stringent regulatory frameworks around data privacy and breach notification, demanding greater transparency and accountability from organizations.

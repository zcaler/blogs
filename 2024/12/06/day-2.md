# Cybersecurity Trends in Late 2024: Quantum Resilience and AI-Driven Threats

The cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve rapidly.

A major trend is the increased focus on quantum-resistant cryptography as quantum computing capabilities advance.

We're seeing more organizations begin migrating sensitive data and systems to algorithms like lattice-based cryptography, spurred by regulatory pressure and fear of "harvest now, decrypt later" attacks.

Simultaneously, AI is being weaponized by threat actors, enabling highly sophisticated phishing campaigns and malware that adapts in real-time to evade detection.

Deepfake technology is also becoming a significant concern, particularly in social engineering attacks targeting executive leadership.

Furthermore, supply chain attacks remain a persistent threat, requiring companies to implement more rigorous vetting processes for third-party vendors and software.

Zero-trust architectures are no longer optional but a necessity for securing critical infrastructure.

Finally, talent shortages in the cybersecurity field persist, making automation and AI-powered security tools even more crucial for overburdened security teams.

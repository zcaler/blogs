# Blockchain Beyond Bitcoin: Innovations at the Close of 2024

It's December 2024, and blockchain technology has firmly moved beyond its Bitcoin origins.

We're seeing tremendous growth in decentralized AI marketplaces, powered by blockchain-secured data provenance and model training.

Federated learning, enabled by layer-2 scaling solutions like ZK-rollups and StarkWare's SHARP technology, is allowing AI models to be trained on sensitive data without ever centralizing it.

Supply chain transparency, once a nascent application, is now commonplace with consortium blockchains tracking everything from pharmaceuticals to critical minerals.

The rise of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), especially fractionalized ownership of real estate and art, is democratizing investment opportunities.

Interoperability protocols have improved, allowing seamless asset transfers between different blockchain ecosystems.

Finally, enterprise adoption is soaring, with major corporations utilizing private and permissioned blockchains for secure data sharing and workflow automation.

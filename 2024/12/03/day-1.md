# Edge Computing's Maturing Ecosystem: December 3rd, 2024

Edge computing has exploded in the last year, largely fueled by the standardization efforts finalized in Q3 2024.

We're finally seeing true vendor interoperability with the release of the IEC 63228-3 protocol suite, making multi-cloud edge deployments significantly easier to manage.

This has enabled smaller businesses to leverage edge resources for previously cost-prohibitive applications like real-time predictive maintenance for manufacturing and localized drone-based delivery systems.

Further fueling this growth is the maturation of AI model pruning techniques, allowing for significantly smaller and more efficient models to run on resource-constrained edge devices.

These models are now being deployed in edge-native containers with almost the same developer experience as their cloud-based counterparts.

Security remains a key focus, with advancements in federated learning addressing data privacy concerns and boosting the adoption of edge solutions in sensitive sectors such as healthcare and finance.

The race is now on for optimized hardware and software combinations for specific industry verticals, pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the edge.

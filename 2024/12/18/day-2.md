# Web Development in Late 2024: A Glimpse at the Future

It's hard to believe another year is almost over! In web development, 2024 has been defined by the continued dominance of AI-powered coding assistants, now seamlessly integrated into most IDEs, handling boilerplate and even suggesting complex algorithm optimizations.

Serverless Edge architectures are truly mainstream, allowing for incredibly low latency and personalized experiences globally.

We're also seeing a surge in adoption of WebAssembly beyond just gaming; companies are leveraging it for high-performance compute tasks directly in the browser.

On the frontend, the debate between React and Vue has largely subsided, with newer, lighter frameworks like SolidJS carving out significant market share thanks to their fine-grained reactivity.

No-code/low-code platforms are maturing, handling increasingly complex workflows, but seasoned developers still find themselves indispensable for custom logic and optimization.

Accessibility is, thankfully, not just a trend but a baseline expectation, driven by stricter regulations and improved AI-powered testing tools.

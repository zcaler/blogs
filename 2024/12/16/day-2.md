# Web Development in Late 2024: AI Integration and Serverless Surge

As 2024 winds down, the biggest buzz in web development revolves around AI-powered tools.

We're seeing more platforms integrate AI directly into the IDE, offering intelligent code completion and automated debugging, significantly boosting developer productivity.

Serverless architectures have become mainstream, driven by frameworks that simplify deployment and scaling, allowing teams to focus on core application logic.

WebAssembly (WASM) is also gaining traction for resource-intensive tasks like image processing and game development directly within the browser, improving performance without relying solely on JavaScript.

There's a continued push for accessibility and performance, with newer web standards emphasizing optimized rendering and improved screen reader compatibility.

Finally, expect to see more sophisticated design systems emerging that use AI to adapt layouts and styles based on user behavior and context.

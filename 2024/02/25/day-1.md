# Web Development Trends: Late February 2024

The web development landscape continues its rapid evolution! We're seeing increased adoption of serverless architectures, particularly with platforms like Netlify and Vercel, streamlining deployment and scaling.

TypeScript's dominance strengthens, offering enhanced code maintainability in larger projects.

Interest in AI-powered development tools is growing, promising to automate tasks and suggest code snippets.

Accessibility is (rightfully) becoming a core consideration, driving adoption of tools like Axe and more comprehensive accessibility audits.

Framework-wise, React still reigns supreme, but Svelte and Vue.js are gaining ground due to their performance and developer experience.

Expect to see further refinement of component-based architectures and a continued push towards improved web performance metrics like Core Web Vitals.

Also, keep an eye on WebAssembly as it matures, opening doors to new performance possibilities.

Finally, the push towards Progressive Web Apps is gaining steam, promising a more app-like experience on the web.

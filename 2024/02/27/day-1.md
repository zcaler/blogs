# Web Dev Hot Takes: Late February 2024

The web development landscape is buzzing! Serverless functions continue their reign, becoming increasingly sophisticated with edge computing integrations like Deno Deploy gaining traction.

We're seeing a surge in interest around AI-powered development tools; expect more code generation and automated testing solutions in the coming months.

On the frontend, component-based architectures remain king, with libraries like React and Vue evolving to better handle complex state management.

The buzz around "full-stack without servers" using technologies like Supabase and Firebase is definitely growing louder.

Accessibility (a11y) is also thankfully becoming a higher priority, integrated directly into frameworks and build processes.

We can also expect some interesting use cases of large language models to show up to enhance user engagement on our websites.

Finally, keep an eye on WebAssembly, it may just sneak into new projects as a way to speed up existing applications.

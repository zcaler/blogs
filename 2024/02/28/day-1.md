# Web Development Trends and Technologies (February 28, 2024)

The web development landscape continues its rapid evolution, with several key trends dominating discussions this February.

Serverless functions are gaining even more traction, driven by their cost-effectiveness and scalability, particularly for microservices architectures.

We're seeing more adoption of WebAssembly (Wasm) outside of the browser, thanks to WASI, allowing for faster and more secure backend computations.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are also solidifying their place as a mainstream approach, offering near-native mobile experiences directly from the web.

AI-powered tools are becoming increasingly integral in the development process, assisting with code completion, testing, and even design.

Finally, accessibility remains a crucial focal point, with developers increasingly prioritizing inclusive design principles and utilizing automated accessibility testing tools to ensure broader user reach and compliance.

Frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular continue to mature, incorporating these trends and pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web.

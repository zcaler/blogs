# Cybersecurity Trends: Late 2024

It's October 2024, and the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve at a breakneck pace.

We're seeing a significant uptick in AI-powered attacks that are capable of sophisticated phishing and social engineering, making traditional defenses less effective.

Quantum-resistant encryption is slowly becoming a necessity, particularly for critical infrastructure, as quantum computing advancements loom.

Supply chain vulnerabilities remain a major concern, with attackers increasingly targeting smaller vendors to gain access to larger organizations.

The regulatory environment is tightening, demanding greater transparency and accountability for data breaches, especially concerning personal and biometric data.

Finally, security automation and orchestration are no longer optional; they're essential for security teams to manage the increasing volume and complexity of threats effectively.

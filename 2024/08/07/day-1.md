# Web Development in Mid-2024: AI Takes Center Stage

August 7th, 2024: It's hard to overstate the impact AI is having on web development right now.

Generative AI tools are no longer just for prototyping; we're seeing them integrated directly into codebases for tasks like automated testing and component generation.

The widespread adoption of serverless functions, further amplified by edge computing, allows for truly dynamic and personalized user experiences.

While React continues its dominance, newer frameworks built around WASM are gaining traction for performance-critical applications.

Accessibility is also receiving renewed focus, driven by stricter regulations and a growing understanding of its importance.

Static site generation is making a comeback, leveraging AI to create dynamic content from typically static sources.

Finally, the increasing popularity of WebGPU promises to unlock more immersive and visually impressive web experiences.

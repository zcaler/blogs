# Edge Computing: Where We're At in Late Summer '24

Edge computing continues its relentless march out of the cloud and into, well, everything.

Today, we're seeing significant advancements in distributed AI model training at the edge.

The introduction of federated learning frameworks designed specifically for resource-constrained edge devices, like the newly released Snapdragon X80 Gen 4, is truly game-changing.

This allows for continuous model improvement without requiring massive data uploads, crucial for preserving user privacy and reducing latency.

Furthermore, the regulatory landscape is slowly catching up, with the EU's Digital Services Act influencing how edge data governance is implemented globally.

Containerization and orchestration platforms, particularly KubeEdge and lightweight Kubernetes distributions, are now practically table stakes for managing the increasing complexity of edge deployments.

Finally, expect a surge in adoption for industrial automation and autonomous vehicle applications powered by these advancements by year-end.

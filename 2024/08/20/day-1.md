# Web Development in the Late Summer of '24: AI Co-pilots and Decentralized Applications Dominate

The web development landscape is buzzing with activity as we head into the final stretch of summer 2024.

AI-powered code completion tools, like advanced iterations of GitHub Copilot and enhanced IDE integrations, are now indispensable for many developers, significantly accelerating development cycles and reducing boilerplate.

We're also seeing a surge in decentralized application (dApp) development, driven by improvements in layer-2 scaling solutions for various blockchains, making them more practical for real-world use cases.

Serverless architectures continue to be popular, with developers increasingly leveraging edge computing for improved performance and user experience.

The push towards more accessible and inclusive web design is also gaining momentum, with automated accessibility testing tools becoming more sophisticated.

Finally, WebAssembly is slowly but surely gaining more traction in more diverse areas like game development and specialized scientific calculations, proving its versatility in bringing near-native speeds to the browser.

It is a great time to be a Web Developer.

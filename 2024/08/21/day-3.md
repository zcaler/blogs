# Web Dev Horizons: August 2024

It's mid-2024, and the web dev landscape continues its relentless evolution.

Serverless functions, particularly those orchestrated with edge computing platforms like Deno Deploy, are no longer a niche, but a standard for performant microservices.

We're seeing significant uptake of WebAssembly outside the browser too, used increasingly for backend modules due to its near-native speed.

The AI integration wave is cresting; frameworks are now offering effortless AI-powered content generation and smart component suggestions.

The push towards declarative UI continues with more teams adopting tools like React Server Components and SolidJS for increased efficiency and improved SEO.

Privacy-preserving technologies are also gaining traction, with demand rising for decentralized identity solutions implemented with Web3 protocols.

Accessibility is no longer an afterthought, with automated testing tools deeply integrated into CI/CD pipelines to ensure inclusive user experiences from the get-go.

Finally, low-code and no-code platforms are gaining serious enterprise adoption, primarily for internal tools and rapid prototyping, freeing up skilled developers for complex applications.

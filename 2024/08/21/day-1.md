# IoT: The Edge is Getting Sharper

August 21, 2024.

It’s amazing how far IoT has come in the last few years.

Decentralized AI and edge computing are truly driving the current wave of innovation.

We’re seeing dedicated AI chips optimized for low-power consumption becoming ubiquitous in sensor nodes, enabling incredibly sophisticated real-time analytics without ever touching the cloud.

This localized processing is reducing latency drastically, which is crucial for applications like autonomous drones and automated manufacturing lines.

Federated learning is also gaining traction, allowing IoT devices to collaboratively train AI models while maintaining data privacy.

The push for open-source hardware and software platforms for IoT is helping to democratize access and accelerate development.

Moreover, the convergence of 5G Advanced and IoT is unlocking new possibilities for ultra-reliable, low-latency communication, driving adoption in critical infrastructure and remote healthcare.

We're finally seeing the promises of a truly connected and intelligent world materialize.

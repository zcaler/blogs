# DevOps on Earth Day: Building Sustainable Pipelines (April 22, 2024)

Happy Earth Day! Today, we're thinking about how DevOps can contribute to a more sustainable future.

The buzz lately is around optimizing CI/CD pipelines for energy efficiency, leveraging tools that monitor resource consumption during builds and deployments.

Kubernetes autoscaling is now commonly tied to real-time energy grid loads, shifting workloads to off-peak, renewable energy hours.

Another exciting trend is the increasing adoption of serverless functions for less frequently accessed applications, reducing idle infrastructure.

We're also seeing advancements in software composition analysis tools that identify and suggest updates to dependencies, not just for security, but also to leverage more energy-efficient code libraries.

Think reduced compute cycles, less wasted resources, and a greener digital footprint.

The shift is towards conscious resource management in every stage of the software lifecycle, from development to decommissioning.

Reducing our carbon footprint, one pipeline at a time!

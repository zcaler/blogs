# Edge Computing: April 8th, 2024 - Federated Learning & 5G-Advanced Take Center Stage

Today, edge computing is rapidly evolving, largely driven by advancements in federated learning and the burgeoning rollout of 5G-Advanced networks.

We're seeing a significant uptick in the adoption of federated learning at the edge to train AI models on decentralized data sources without compromising privacy, particularly in healthcare and autonomous vehicle applications.

The faster speeds and lower latencies promised by 5G-Advanced are becoming crucial for deploying these models in real-time, enabling instantaneous decision-making in scenarios like predictive maintenance on industrial equipment.

Hardware vendors are responding by optimizing edge devices for both AI inference and distributed training, often incorporating specialized accelerators.

Security remains paramount, and standardization efforts are focused on robust edge-to-cloud communication protocols that are resilient against adversarial attacks.

The move to software-defined edges is accelerating, providing greater flexibility and scalability for diverse application workloads, paving the way for truly intelligent and responsive IoT ecosystems.

We expect to see even greater convergence between edge computing, AI, and advanced connectivity throughout the remainder of 2024.

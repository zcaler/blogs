# Edge Computing: Spring 2024 Insights

Edge computing continues its rapid evolution, driven by the insatiable demand for real-time data processing, particularly evident in the automotive industry with autonomous driving advancements.

This quarter, we're seeing significant traction in federated learning at the edge, allowing AI models to be trained across decentralized devices without compromising data privacy, addressing a key concern for healthcare and finance applications.

Major cloud providers are also aggressively expanding their edge infrastructure offerings, partnering with telecom companies to push compute closer to the user.

A particularly interesting development is the increased adoption of Kubernetes at the edge, streamlining the deployment and management of containerized applications in distributed environments.

While standardization efforts are still underway, initiatives like the EdgeX Foundry are gaining momentum.

We anticipate further breakthroughs in power efficiency for edge devices to be critical for scaling IoT deployments in the coming months.

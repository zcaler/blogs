# Big Data Analytics: April 3rd, 2024 - The Rise of Serverless and Explainable AI

Big Data Analytics in Q2 2024 is seeing significant traction with serverless architectures.

Businesses are leveraging cloud-native platforms like AWS Glue and Azure Synapse Analytics to process petabytes of data without the overhead of managing infrastructure.

This is driving down costs and accelerating time-to-insight.

Simultaneously, explainable AI (XAI) is becoming a critical component, particularly in regulated industries.

Model interpretability is no longer a nice-to-have; it's a necessity for compliance and building trust with stakeholders.

Tools and techniques like SHAP values and LIME are being integrated directly into analytics pipelines.

The ongoing chip shortage continues to impact hardware availability, prompting further optimization of existing infrastructure and a push for resource-efficient algorithms.

Real-time data streaming from IoT devices remains a key data source, but security considerations are prompting advancements in edge computing and federated learning for privacy preservation.

Finally, the talent gap in specialized roles like data engineers and data scientists continues to be a challenge, pushing companies to invest in upskilling initiatives and low-code/no-code platforms.

# IoT: Matter Takes Center Stage as Thread Adoption Accelerates (April 29, 2024)

The IoT landscape is buzzing this spring, largely thanks to the continued rollout of Matter.

We're seeing more and more devices from major manufacturers finally embracing the standard, simplifying interoperability nightmares of the past.

Particularly exciting is the noticeable uptick in Thread adoption, especially among smart home hubs and sensor networks.

This mesh networking protocol provides the robustness and low-power consumption necessary for truly pervasive IoT deployments.

Security remains a key focus, with ongoing efforts to harden Matter's implementation against potential vulnerabilities.

Supply chain issues, while improving, are still impacting the availability of certain Matter-certified components, causing slight delays.

Developers are actively exploring AI-powered edge computing on IoT devices to enhance local decision-making.

The integration of 5G and NB-IoT is also enabling wider deployments in areas with limited Wi-Fi access.

Finally, expect further refinements to the Matter protocol itself as the CSA continues to address real-world implementation challenges.

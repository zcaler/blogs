# Edge Computing: Shifting Left and Getting Smarter (April 25, 2024)

Edge computing is continuing its march towards becoming a critical infrastructure component, especially as 5G rollouts further democratize low-latency access.

We're seeing a significant increase in the adoption of specialized AI accelerators, like the latest NVIDIA Orin variants, optimized for running complex models directly on edge devices.

This is particularly evident in smart manufacturing and autonomous driving, where real-time processing is paramount.

Federated learning at the edge is also gaining traction, allowing for model training on decentralized datasets without compromising data privacy â€“ crucial for healthcare and financial services.

Security remains a top concern, with advancements in hardware-based attestation and zero-trust architectures becoming increasingly prevalent in edge deployments.

Open source frameworks like KubeEdge and Eclipse IoT are streamlining deployment and management, reducing the barriers to entry for smaller organizations.

Expect to see more hybrid edge-cloud architectures dominating conversations in the coming months, enabling flexible and scalable solutions.

Finally, the decreasing cost of edge hardware combined with these advancements is accelerating the proliferation of edge deployments across diverse industries.

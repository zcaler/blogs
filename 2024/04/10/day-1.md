# Edge Computing: Smart Factories and the Rise of 5G Slicing (April 10, 2024)

Edge computing continues its rapid expansion into manufacturing, driven by the increasing availability of affordable and robust 5G infrastructure.

We're seeing a significant uptick in smart factory deployments, leveraging edge servers for real-time data processing from IoT sensors monitoring equipment performance.

A key trend is the adoption of 5G network slicing, allowing factories to dedicate specific bandwidth and latency parameters to critical edge applications like predictive maintenance and robotic control.

This customized connectivity eliminates network bottlenecks and ensures consistent performance even during peak demand.

Security remains a paramount concern, with vendors now offering integrated edge security solutions that incorporate zero-trust principles and threat intelligence feeds tailored to the industrial environment.

Look for continued advancements in AI-powered analytics at the edge, enabling even more sophisticated decision-making and process optimization directly on the factory floor.

Early reports indicate a substantial reduction in downtime and improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) for early adopters.

We expect this trend to accelerate throughout the year as more manufacturers realize the benefits of combining edge computing with 5G and AI.

# IoT: Where We're At in '24

Okay, IoT enthusiasts, let's take a quick snapshot of where things stand in late July 2024.

The big story remains the seamless integration of AI at the edge.

Remember when edge computing was just a buzzword? Now, processing power directly on devices has unlocked true real-time insights for applications like predictive maintenance and autonomous vehicles.

The proliferation of low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs), specifically enhanced NB-IoT implementations, means connectivity isn't the bottleneck it used to be, especially in dense urban environments.

Supply chain visibility has also dramatically improved, thanks to miniature, energy-harvesting tags tracking goods across continents.

Security, thankfully, is finally being baked in from the ground up, a direct response to those early, horrifying botnet attacks.

We're also seeing a surge in "digital twins" powered by IoT sensor data, enabling businesses to simulate and optimize entire ecosystems.

Expect further advancements in battery technology and energy harvesting to keep powering this revolution, driving towards a truly connected world.

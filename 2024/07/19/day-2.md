# Web Development Hot Takes: Mid-2024 Edition

The web development landscape continues its rapid evolution! AI-powered code generation tools like GitHub Copilot are becoming indispensable for boosting productivity, even though debugging AI-generated code still presents unique challenges.

Serverless functions are solidifying their dominance, driven by platforms like Deno Deploy, simplifying back-end infrastructure and reducing operational overhead.

We're seeing a resurgence of interest in WebAssembly (WASM), especially for resource-intensive applications directly within the browser, moving beyond just gaming.

Furthermore, accessibility-first development is no longer a niche concern but a core principle, with integrated accessibility testing tools becoming commonplace in CI/CD pipelines.

The ongoing standardization of web components is enabling more reusable and maintainable codebases across frameworks.

Finally, the rise of edge computing networks is pushing content closer to users, optimizing for speed and responsiveness in increasingly demanding web applications.

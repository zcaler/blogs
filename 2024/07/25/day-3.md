# DevOps in 2024: Serverless Continues to Evolve

It's hard to believe we're almost through another year, and the rapid evolution of DevOps continues! Serverless architectures are now the default choice for many new projects, leveraging enhanced platforms like Knative for even more flexibility across containerized workloads.

AI-powered observability tools have become indispensable, proactively identifying performance bottlenecks before they impact users, a necessity considering the increasing complexity of distributed systems.

Security automation is also more tightly integrated into CI/CD pipelines, shifting left with policy-as-code frameworks that ensure compliance from the initial commit.

We are also seeing increased adoption of service meshes like Istio and Linkerd, making microservice management more manageable.

Finally, there is increased focus on platform engineering, with teams building internal developer portals for self-service infrastructure and tooling.

# IoT Evolution: Edge Intelligence and Federated Learning Take Center Stage

It's July 10th, 2024, and the Internet of Things landscape is increasingly defined by edge intelligence.

We're seeing a massive shift from centralized cloud processing to deploying sophisticated machine learning models directly on IoT devices.

Federated learning, where devices collaboratively train a shared model without explicitly exchanging data, is also gaining serious traction.

This is particularly crucial for maintaining user privacy and reducing bandwidth consumption, especially with the continued proliferation of sensors in smart homes and autonomous vehicles.

The rollout of reliable, low-latency 6G networks is further accelerating this trend, enabling near-real-time analytics and decision-making at the edge.

Standardized secure boot processes and hardware-level security are also becoming mandatory as device vulnerabilities are increasingly exploited.

The focus is no longer just about connecting things; it's about enabling them to think, learn, and act autonomously while prioritizing security and data privacy.

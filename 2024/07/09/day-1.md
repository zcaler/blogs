Code generation tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated, assisting with everything from component creation to automated testing.

Serverless architectures continue their rise, driven by improved cost efficiency and scalability offered by providers like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.

The shift towards WebAssembly for high-performance applications in the browser is also notable, allowing for near-native speeds for computationally intensive tasks.

Accessibility remains a top priority, with stricter regulations and a greater focus on inclusive design principles.

Finally, the metaverse's influence is subtly shaping development, with increased experimentation in 3D web technologies and interactive experiences built using frameworks like Babylon.js and Three.js.

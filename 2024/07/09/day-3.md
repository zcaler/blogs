# Cybersecurity Trends: Mid-2024 Checkpoint

As we hit the midpoint of 2024, several cybersecurity trends are dominating headlines and shaping defense strategies.

AI-powered phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, mimicking user behavior and evading traditional detection methods.

Quantum computing's threat to current encryption algorithms is no longer theoretical, pushing organizations to invest in post-quantum cryptography research and implementation.

Supply chain vulnerabilities continue to be a major concern, especially with the rise of geopolitical tensions impacting global software dependencies.

We're also seeing a surge in attacks targeting critical infrastructure, prompting calls for enhanced public-private partnerships and stricter regulatory oversight.

Finally, the talent shortage in cybersecurity persists, leading to a greater reliance on automation and managed security services to augment in-house capabilities.

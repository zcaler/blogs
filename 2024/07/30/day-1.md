# IoT in 2024: Edge Intelligence Takes Center Stage

It's been a wild ride for IoT the past few years, but 2024 is proving to be the year of truly smart edge computing.

We're finally seeing widespread deployment of federated learning models directly on devices, enabling real-time AI processing without constant cloud reliance.

This is crucial for latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and smart factory robotics which are now hitting their stride.

5G mmWave networks are providing the high-bandwidth, low-latency connectivity needed to keep those edge devices updated and communicating effectively.

Security is, of course, still a major concern, but new hardware-level security features in IoT chips are helping mitigate many past vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are seeing increased adoption outside of just agricultural and environmental monitoring.

Weâ€™re finding innovative uses in city-wide asset tracking and even personal health monitoring devices.

The convergence of AI, 5G, and increasingly secure hardware makes this a very exciting time to be working in the IoT space.

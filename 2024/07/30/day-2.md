# Web Dev in Late Summer '24: Composables, AI-Powered Tooling, and the Rise of WASM

It's late July 2024, and the web development landscape is shifting rapidly.

Composable architecture is no longer just a buzzword; frameworks are embracing it wholeheartedly, leading to more modular and maintainable codebases.

AI-powered tooling is becoming indispensable, especially for code completion and automated accessibility audits, significantly speeding up development cycles.

We're also seeing increased adoption of WebAssembly (WASM) beyond just niche applications; its performance benefits are driving broader use for complex computations and even entire front-end frameworks are experimenting with WASM backends.

The metaverse push hasn't fully materialized, but expect more integrations around WebXR.

Serverless functions are also evolving, offering improved state management and event handling capabilities.

Keeping an eye on these trends is crucial for any web dev looking to stay relevant in this dynamic environment.

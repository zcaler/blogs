# IoT: Where Are We Now, Mid-2024?

It's July 2024, and the Internet of Things (IoT) landscape looks markedly different than even a year ago.

Federated learning is finally delivering on its promise, allowing IoT devices to train AI models collaboratively without transmitting sensitive data, leading to significantly improved performance in edge computing scenarios like predictive maintenance.

We're seeing widespread adoption of Matter 2.0, which is drastically simplifying interoperability between different smart home ecosystems.

Security remains a key focus, with hardware-level security enhancements and blockchain-based identity management becoming increasingly common.

Supply chain bottlenecks are still impacting certain IoT device availability, but less severely than in previous years.

5G rollouts have boosted bandwidth, enabling more complex IoT applications requiring low latency, such as autonomous robotics in warehouses.

The rise of digital twins is fueling new innovation, allowing simulations to optimize and refine the performance of IoT-enabled industrial operations.

Ultimately, the maturation of supporting technologies has finally allowed IoT to transition from hype to true industrial and consumer value.

# Cloud Computing Update: July 16, 2024

The big news today revolves around the accelerated adoption of federated AI clouds.

Companies are increasingly leveraging hybrid models to run sensitive AI workloads on-premise while tapping into public cloud resources for training and inference on larger, less critical datasets.

Expect to see even greater standardization around inter-cloud communication protocols over the next quarter, especially as data residency regulations tighten globally.

Quantum computing integration remains a hot topic; AWS, Azure, and GCP are all teasing more accessible quantum hardware and software development kits, though practical applications beyond research are still nascent.

Serverless architectures are also seeing a renaissance thanks to the proliferation of WebAssembly runtimes, enabling more efficient and cost-effective edge computing deployments.

Finally, cybersecurity concerns, especially regarding advanced persistent threats targeting cloud infrastructure, are driving investment in AI-powered threat detection and response systems tailored specifically for cloud environments.

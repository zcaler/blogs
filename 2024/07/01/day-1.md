# Cloud Computing Mid-Year Update: AI Integration and Serverless Advancements Dominate

The first half of 2024 has witnessed a significant push towards deeper AI integration within cloud platforms.

We're seeing more native services offering pre-trained models for specific industries, drastically simplifying AI adoption for businesses of all sizes.

Simultaneously, serverless architectures are becoming increasingly sophisticated, moving beyond simple function triggers to encompass entire application deployments.

This shift is powered by advanced event-driven systems and robust orchestration tools, leading to unprecedented scalability and cost optimization.

The rise of confidential computing is also gaining momentum, with cloud providers offering more secure enclaves and trusted execution environments to protect sensitive data in the cloud.

Expect these trends to accelerate as we move into the second half of the year, further blurring the lines between cloud infrastructure and intelligent applications.

Finally, expect to see better multi-cloud management tools which reduce complexity with the continued growth of cloud deployments.

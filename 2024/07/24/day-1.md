# Edge Computing in Mid-2024: Enhanced Security and Federated Learning Taking Center Stage

July 24, 2024.

We're seeing a surge in demand for edge computing deployments, especially those prioritizing security.

The rise in sophisticated ransomware attacks targeting IoT devices has pushed edge-based security protocols to the forefront.

Federated learning at the edge is also gaining traction, allowing AI models to be trained on decentralized datasets without compromising data privacy â€“ crucial for healthcare and finance applications.

New hardware specifically optimized for federated learning at the edge, like the next-gen NVIDIA Jetson series, are hitting the market.

This decentralized approach is unlocking powerful AI insights while minimizing data transfer and latency, leading to more efficient and secure IoT solutions.

Cloud providers are also bolstering their edge offerings with enhanced orchestration and management tools to simplify deployment across vast geographically dispersed environments.

Expect to see even more innovation in edge security and federated learning in the coming months as the technology matures.

# Machine Learning Leaps in Spring 2024

May 10, 2024, marks an exciting period for machine learning.

We're seeing remarkable advancements in generative AI, particularly in video generation with models like Sora's successor edging closer to photorealistic quality and coherent narratives.

The focus has shifted to improving controllability and reducing "hallucinations" across all generative models.

Federated learning is also gaining traction, especially in healthcare, allowing for collaborative model training without compromising patient data privacy.

New research is highlighting the potential of neuromorphic computing for drastically reducing the energy consumption of complex ML models, paving the way for sustainable AI.

Self-supervised learning continues its reign, powering breakthroughs in language understanding and enabling more efficient pre-training on vast, unlabeled datasets.

Finally, reinforcement learning is finding practical applications in robotics and autonomous systems with improved sample efficiency and robustness to environmental changes.

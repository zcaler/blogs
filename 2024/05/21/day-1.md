# IoT: Where We Are Now - May 21, 2024

The IoT landscape continues its rapid evolution here in mid-2024.

We're seeing increased adoption of edge computing architectures, driven by the need for low-latency processing in applications like autonomous vehicles and smart manufacturing.

Matter, the unifying connectivity standard, is finally starting to realize its potential, with more certified devices appearing on the market, albeit slower than initially projected.

Security remains a primary concern, and the industry is actively developing and implementing more robust end-to-end encryption and authentication protocols.

Supply chain constraints, though easing somewhat, still impact device availability and pricing.

AI integration within IoT devices is becoming commonplace, enabling more sophisticated data analysis and predictive maintenance.

Looking ahead, the convergence of IoT with other emerging technologies like blockchain and 6G holds immense promise for enhanced security and connectivity.

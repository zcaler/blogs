# Web Development Trends and Technologies - May 21, 2024

The web development landscape in mid-2024 continues its rapid evolution.

Serverless functions are becoming even more prevalent, with developers leveraging platforms like AWS Lambda and Netlify Functions for increased scalability and reduced operational overhead.

Micro-frontends are gaining traction for complex applications, enabling independent team ownership and faster deployment cycles.

Observability, encompassing monitoring, tracing, and logging, is no longer optional but a critical component of modern web applications.

AI-powered development tools, such as GitHub Copilot, are helping to boost developer productivity.

The focus on web performance, especially Core Web Vitals, remains paramount, driving adoption of technologies like image optimization CDNs and improved JavaScript bundling techniques.

Finally, accessibility standards are rightly taking center stage, with increased emphasis on inclusive design practices and automated accessibility testing.

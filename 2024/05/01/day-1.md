# Edge Computing: Smarter, Faster, Closer (May 1, 2024)

Edge computing is evolving rapidly, particularly in support of burgeoning AI applications.

Today, we're seeing increased adoption of specialized silicon, like custom-designed ASICs from companies like NVIDIA and Google, deployed directly at the edge to accelerate inferencing.

This is driven by the demand for real-time decision making in industries like autonomous vehicles and smart manufacturing.

5G rollouts continue to enhance edge connectivity, enabling lower latency and higher bandwidth for data transmission.

Containerization and orchestration platforms, like Kubernetes, are also becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing for more efficient management of edge deployments across geographically distributed locations.

We are observing significant advancements in federated learning models operating at the edge, allowing for model training closer to the data source while maintaining data privacy.

The focus now is on developing more robust security protocols and standardized APIs to facilitate interoperability and unlock the full potential of edge computing across diverse sectors.

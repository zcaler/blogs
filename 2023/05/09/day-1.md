# Web Development Embraces the Return of Server-Side Rendering

Web development frameworks are experiencing a significant shift back toward server-side rendering (SSR) approaches, marking a departure from the client-side rendering paradigm that dominated the 2010s.

This "back to the future" moment is driven by frameworks like Next.js, Remix, and Astro that seamlessly blend server and client rendering to optimize both performance and developer experience.

The rise of React Server Components represents a major architectural evolution, allowing components to run exclusively on the server, reducing JavaScript bundle sizes and improving initial page load performance while maintaining React's component model.

Meta Frameworks that build on top of UI libraries like React, Vue, and Svelte are becoming the standard approach for production applications, offering integrated solutions for routing, data fetching, and deployment that simplify the development experience.

Edge computing platforms have accelerated this trend by making server-side rendering more globally performant, executing code closer to users while eliminating cold starts that plagued earlier serverless implementations.

The improved user experience of server-rendered applications—with faster initial loads, better SEO, and reduced client-side JavaScript—has made SSR approaches particularly attractive for content-heavy sites and e-commerce applications where performance directly impacts business metrics.

This return to server rendering doesn't abandon the interactivity benefits of modern JavaScript frameworks, but rather combines the best of both worlds through partial hydration, island architecture, and streaming rendering techniques.

New frameworks are designing for this hybrid world from the ground up, with file-based routing conventions, nested layouts, and built-in data loading patterns that simplify building applications that render appropriately for each use case.
